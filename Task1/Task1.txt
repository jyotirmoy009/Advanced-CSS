TASK1. Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css.

Answer - 

The var() function in CSS has two major purposes:

Custom Properties (CSS Variables): It enables us to include the value of a custom property (also known as a "CSS variable") 
into other property values. These variables can be defined globally or locally using appropriate selectors.

Dynamic Value Insertion: Using var(), we can define reusable values for properties such as colors, font sizes, and margins. 
Instead of hardcoding certain values into our styles, we specify them as variables and then reference them as needed. 
This simplifies maintaining and upgrading our styles.
